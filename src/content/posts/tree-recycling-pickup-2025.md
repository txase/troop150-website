The holidays are full of joy and celebration, but they also come with cleanup duty. Never fear! Troop 150/5150 is here to make it easy and painless for you recycle your Christmas tree in an eco-friendly way while supporting our scouts!

Simply fill out our pickup order form [here](/treerecycling) and we'll come pick up your tree from your curb on Saturday, January 10th, 2026. Or, you can use the same form to pre-pay your donation and then drop off your tree at our collection site at St. Andrews Presbyterian Church (3228 SW Sunset Blvd, Portland, OR 97239) between 9am and 4pm any weekend day from January 3rd through the 18th.

Thanks for your support of Troop 150/5150!
